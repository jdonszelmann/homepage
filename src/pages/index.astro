                        to be professional, bear with me for a sec. I sometimes
                        use computers, something something Rust, you get the
                        gist. Quite gay, likes kitties, and cute girls who are
                        sometimes also kitties etc. Has been described as "quite
                        hot". Oh I have ADHD btw. Trans rights are human rights.
                        Did I mention I like girls? Yeah, pretty gay. Warning: I
                        bite.

                        I'm a software developer from Delft, The Netherlands. I
                        work for my own company,
                        <a href="https://hexcat.nl">Hexcat</a> and the RustNL
                        foundation. A large part of my job is to work on
                        <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust">rustc</a>,
                        the rust compiler, being a member of the compiler team.
                        Additionally, every year I help co-organize
                        <a href="https://rustweek.org">Rust Week</a>, the
                        largest rust conference. Before that, I used to teach
                        computer science and embedded systems at the University
                        of Delft, giving and developing three courses called
                        <i>Software Fundamentals</i>, <i>Software Systems</i>,
                        and the <i>Embedded Systems Lab</i>. All these courses
                        used Rust as their primary programming language.

            I occasionally write blog posts, mainly about Rust, which you can
            find <a href="/blog">here</a>

            You might also be interested in some websites I host:

                    A visualization of the work I did for my bachelor's thesis
                    at <a href="https://mapf.donsz.nl">mapf.donsz.nl</a>, and an
                    overview of it at <a href="https://mapfm-poster.donsz.nl"

                    Some excellent resources on compiler construction from when
                    I studied at the TU Delft at <a
                        href="https://compiler-construction-2021.donsz.nl"
                        >compiler-construction-2021.donsz.nl</a
                    >. Its author, my professor, unfortunately passed away far
                    too early, and these resources slowly started to disappear.
