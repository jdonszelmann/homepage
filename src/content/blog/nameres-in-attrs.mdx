    An alternate title for this post could have been "Parse, don't validate", but that title was already taken by a [brilliant blog post](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/), the lessons of which I often try to live by.
    I do think this post serves as yet another example to demonstrate the importance of this rule.
    This rabbit hole started when I was implementing [Externally Implementable Items](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/125418) (EII, from now on) in rustc.
    I'll talk a little about what that is, and why I didn't get very far.
    Soon after starting, I got horrified by how built-attributes were implemented in the compiler,
    and got a little distracted trying to change this.
    So, after introducing EII a little, I'll show you what built-in attributes are, how they used to work,
    why specifically resolving the definition of a path in an attribute was near impossible,
    and what changes I'm making to improve the situation.

## Externally implementable items

Let's start with some context.
I promise we'll get to attributes soon.
But how did we get here?

Externally implementable items, are items that are declared in one crate and implemented in another.
That explanation might sound a little abstract, so let's illustrate that idea with an example.

In `#![no_std]` code (like programs targetting embedded systems), it is quite common to have to write your own panic handler.
Because in these environments a panic cannot exit to an operating system, this handler is necessary to define what should happen.

```rust
#![no_std]

#[panic_handler]
fn panic(info: &PanicInfo) -> ! {
    // Maybe print over a serial line? Reboot the processor? Who knows
    loop {}
}
```

When you write a panic handler, you are effectively implementing a function that `core` is expecting to exist.
At the time of writing, a `panic!()` will eventually call into this code in `core`:

```rust
extern "Rust" {
    // we expect a symbol with this name to exist somewhere in the program.
    // the linker makes sure this call resolves to that symbol!
    #[lang = "panic_impl"]
    fn panic_impl(pi: &PanicInfo<'_>) -> !;
}

// ...

let pi = PanicInfo::new(/* ... */);
unsafe { panic_impl(&pi) }
```

`panic_impl` will be the panic handler you defined using the `#[panic_handler]` attribute.
This is an example of an externally implementable item.
The declaration comes from `core`, and the implementation is given in another crate, in this case *your* crate.

I realise this might be new to some people reading this.
When you often write high level code, it is totally possible to have never even seen a `#[panic_handler]` before.
In most rust code, `std` provides a default implementation which might print a stack trace and then exits to the operating system.
This actually means that when you write this code in a crate without `#![no_std]` at the top:

```rust
#[panic_handler]
fn panic(info: &PanicInfo) -> ! {
    loop {}
}
```

You get an error talking about a "duplicate lang item `panic_impl`", which has a "first definition in `std`".
That should now make sense, there can only be one implementation of the EII in the final binary.

Some other examples that behave like externally implementable items are:

- The global allocator, implemented using `#[global_allocator]`. This is a `static`, not a `fn` but it still works the same.
- Various language items like `#[lang = "eh_personality"]`
- In a way, the `main` function is an EII. When a binary is executed, it expects an implementation of `main`
- You could imagine a logger being registered this way

Existing EII are all magically built into the compiler, often using what are called "lang items".
However, the idea is that in the future any crate could declare an EII for another crate to implement.
This is what [various](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3632) [rfcs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3635) [were](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3645 ) about:

Over the previous summer, <User name="m-ou-se" /> and I came up with a plan we both like a lot, which is slightly different from these RFCs.
It works as follows; a crate can declare the existence of an EII:

```rust
#[externally_implementable(thing_handler)]
fn do_thing();
```

> Note: let's not bikeshed too much about naming here, that can always be changed.

Anyone can call this `do_thing` function, trusting that the compiler checks that somewhere, usually in a different crate, an implementation is given.
To give this implementation, `externally_implementable` *also* creates a *new* attribute macro called `thing_handler`.
Putting this attribute on a function, very much like with `#[panic_handler]`, an implementation can be marked:

```rust
#[thing_handler]
fn my_thing_handler() {
    // ...
}
```

A hypothetical panic handler declaration, using EII, would look like this:

```rust
#[externally_implementable(panic_handler)]
fn panic_impl(info: &PanicInfo);
```

The neat thing with this design is that it is backwards compatible with how `panic_handler` works right now!

## Implementing EII in the compiler

`externally_implementable` is a built-in macro, an attribute macro that the compiler supplies by default.
As with any macro, we can look at what it expands to:
There are two important parts to it:

```rust
#[externally_implementable(panic_handler)]
fn panic_impl(info: &PanicInfo);

// would roughly expand to:

//1. a symbol to call (though this call is safe,
//   because the compiler checks that there is
//   definitely an implementation.
extern "Rust" {
    fn panic_impl(info: &PanicInfo)
}

// 2. a macro to connect the implementation to the declaration
#[i_am_secretly_an_attribute_macro]
macro_rules! panic_handler { /* ... */ }

```

> A macro that expands to the definition of another macro is something that doesn't really have any precedent.
> However, it turns out that all the infrastructure for it does already exist, which is very helpful.

The next thing to look at would be what this newly generated `panic_handler` attribute expands to when you put *it* on something.

```rust
#[panic_handler]
fn panic(info: &PanicInfo) -> ! {
    loop {}
}

// would roughly expand to:

#[provides_implementation_for(core::panic_impl)]
fn panic(info: &PanicInfo) -> ! {
    loop {}
}
```

It might seem strange here that I'm proposing that an attribute macro expands to *another* attribute macro.
However, this really is the plan. Though a logical question might be...

## Macros expanding to other macros? Where does it end?

*This* is where for me the rabbit hole really started.
Rust secretly has two different kinds of attributes:

1. Attribute macros, some of which are built in to the compiler

Attribute macros transform a sequence of tokens (a `TokenStream`) into another sequence of tokens.
Sometimes these are even called "Syntax Extensions" in the compiler.
You can define these extensions yourself, in "proc macro crates".
Rust also has a couple attribute macros built-in, like `#[derive(...)]` and `#[test]`.

2. Built-in attributes

I understand the naming here is confusing with "built-in attribute macros".
It certainly confused me at first.
However, built-in attributes *are not macros at all*.
They look like a macro, but have no expansion.
Instead, built-in attributes are kept around for the entire compilation process.
I like to say that they guide the compilation process,
annotating certain bits of code to modify how they are compiled.

A good example of this is `#[inline]`.
`#[inline]` does not expand to anything.
Instead, it changes how the code for a function is generated way later in the compilation process.

`#[provides_implementation_for(core::panic_impl)]` would be such a built-in attribute.
It simply marks to the compiler that the function that it is put on is an implementation for `core::panic_impl`.
Then later stages in the compiler can generate the right code for this.

When we were designing EII, this seemed like a reasonable solution.
However, we are expecting here that a name resolution occurs.
And, it turns out, essentially no other built-in attribute does that.
Specifically, we want the path `core::panic_impl` to resolve properly, so we can make this link between the implementation and declaration.
No other built-in attribute does this, because it unfortunately turns out to be quite incompatible with how attributes are currently implemented in the compiler.

## A brief overview of name resolution

In rustc, name resolution and macro expansion are essentially one step.
Both processes alternate until no more progress can be made.
This is called a [fixed point](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/76763/what-is-a-fixpoint).
This is necessary, because we need to resolve the names of macros,
while at the same time, the result of expanding a macro can also contain new paths to resolve, even to more macros!

The result of name resolution is a [large number of maps](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/7bb98889534d597911263d647424557b414770ec/compiler/rustc_resolve/src/lib.rs#L1009-L1209),
that contain information about what paths refer to what definition sites.
All definitions sites have a unique `DefId`, and the way these `DefId`s are generated matters a lot because of incremental compilation.
One piece of information that is important here, is another kind of ID, a `NodeId`.
Node here means an AST node, and many parts of the AST get one after parsing, so name resolution can later refer to parts of the AST.

Finally, after all name resolution is over, the AST is lowered into the highlevel intermediate representation, or HIR.

So, if we want names to resolve in attributes, they just need a NodeId. great!
We can just give them one when we parse them.
Let's see, when does rustc parse built-in attributes?

## When does rustc parse built-in attributes?

This question gets its own section, because the answer is, unfortunately, complicated.
When I first looked into this, I was horrified to learn that the answer depends on which attribute we are talking about.
Built-in attributes mainly exist to modify how rust compiles certain bits of syntax (remember, like `#[inline]`).
So at some point the attribute is *applied*. `#[inline]` is applied when function signatures are code generated.

Until december 2024, all built-in attributes followed the same common process before being applied:

1. they were tokenized

That's it.

While most parts of the AST are lowered to HIR after name resolution.
Attributes were an exception, and were instead kept around as an unparsed sequence of tokens.
This means that there was no type called `hir::Attribute`.
A `hir::Item` still contains a list of `ast::Attribute`s, creating a weird situation.

This is especially clear, when you consider that attributes *did* need some processing during ast lowering.
We didn't want to unnecessarily keep all information in attributes around after lowering, that would be very wasteful and unnecessary.
So, the lowering of attributes involved deleting half the properties, setting them to empty lists.
Later on in the compiler, these properties are validated several times.

Another lowering step for attributes was the following.
The right hand side of an attribute with an equals sign like the one below, is the only one that is sort-of parsed.
This is done to support including files in documentation like below:

```rust
#![doc = include_str!("../README.md")]
```

The right hand side is parsed as an expression, but this is a bit of a lie.
AST lowering makes sure that it really can only be a literal, not an arbitrary expression.
That's fine, specifically for the example with documentation, because the `include_str!()` macro expands to a single string literal.

So, an `AttrArgsEq`, as this is called, used to look something like this:

```rust
enum AttrArgsEq {
    Ast(ast::Expr),
    Hir(hir::Literal),
}
```

*All code* that deals with attribute needed to consider these two options,
while before lowering, all attributes contain `AttrArgsEq::Ast` and after lowering,
all attributes contain `AttrArgsEq::Hir`.
Most places dealt with this with something like this:

```rust
match attr_args_eq {
    AttrArgsEq::Ast(/* ... */) => /* ... */,
    AttrArgsEq::Hir(..) => unreachable!()
}
```

Or later in the compiler the opposite, asserting that `AttrArgsEq::Ast` is unreachable.
However, I have also found places where this was not realised,
and an implementation for both was given, while one will absolutely never be executed...
More worryingly, there are also places (like `rustc_ast_pretty`) where both implementations were given,
because both paths *were* reachable, but no indication was given why.
The code that pretty prints the HIR, for attributes calls back into the code that prints the AST.

Some attributes were parsed once to validate them after HIR lowering happened.
They were then often parsed again when applied.
Parsing is usually done by effectively comparing strings, and there's no exhaustive list of all built-in attributes.
This is what some typical parsing code looks like:

```rust
codegen_fn_attrs.inline = attrs.iter().fold(InlineAttr::None, |ia, attr| {
    // is the name inline?
    if !attr.has_name(sym::inline) {
        return ia;
    }
    // if no arguments are given, it's a hint
    if attr.is_word() {
        InlineAttr::Hint
    } else if let Some(ref items) = attr.meta_item_list() {
        inline_span = Some(attr.span);
        if items.len() != 1 {
            struct_span_code_err!(/* ... */, "expected one argument").emit();
            // not inline
            InlineAttr::None
        } else if list_contains_name(items, sym::always) {
            // always
            InlineAttr::Always
        } else if list_contains_name(items, sym::never) {
            // never
            InlineAttr::Never
        } else {
            struct_span_code_err!(/* ... */, "invalid argument")
                .with_help("valid inline arguments are `always` and `never`")
                .emit();

            InlineAttr::None
        }
    } else {
        // this is a fold, so if this didn't work,
        // return whatever the previous `inline` setting
        // was based on previous attributes
        ia
    }
});
```

And remember, this is parsing and validating individual tokens during code generation.
All this means that it is easy to forget to validate one.
For example, `allow_internal_unstable` is valid on macros like this:

```rust
#[macro_export]
#[allow_internal_unstable(type_ascription)]
macro_rules! static_assert {
    ($test:expr) => {
        #[allow(dead_code)]
        const _: () = [()][!($test) as usize];
    }
}
```
However, putting the attribute on a non-macro was [silently ignored](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/133791).

Another example is `align` on functions. This should align the address of a function.
However, duplicating the attribute was [silently allowed, and the alignment is not applied](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/132464).

```rust
// foo has an address which is a multiple of 256
#[repr(align(256))]
fn foo() {}

// not aligned at all, even though we asked it to twice!
#[repr(align(256), align(256))]
fn foo() {}

trait Bar {
    // as a bonus, this causes a panic in the compiler itself
    #[repr(align)]
    fn foo() {}
}
```

Another example was `#[track_caller]`, normally only valid on functions.
However, putting it on a `static` [crashes the compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/131787):

```rust
// internal compiler error!
#[track_caller]
static no_mangle: u32 = {
    unimplemented!();
};
```

Some attributes have various different points in the compiler where they are applied in the compiler.
Often this meant they were parsed multiple times, in these locations.
Sometimes they were parsed in more than one way.

Some built-in attributes have associated warnings.
For example, when writing the following:

```rust
#[inline(never)]
#[inline(always)]
fn foo()
```

Rust warns that `#[inline(always)]` is unused, and `#[inline(never)]` is the one that is applied.
This is, in fact, wrong.
If you study the code above that parses `inline` attributes, you'll see that
`#[inline(always)]` is the one that is actually applied, and `#[inline(never)]` is ignored.
This is because in the place where `inline` is applied, is not the same place as where this warning is emitted.
And the sequence of inline attributes is parsed differently in these two places.

The way in which attributes were parsed varies wildly, and might look completely different for two attributes.
A quick look around shows that there were about 100 different sites in the compiler where attributes were parsed,
and few look alike. No part of this looks like parsing.
The structure of attributes is validated over and over again.

Importantly for us, attributes are not parsed before name resolution.
So we cannot give parts of them `NodeId`s, and so we cannot resolve attributes in them because we have no `NodeId` to attach the resolution to.

## Rewriting attribute handling

So, instead of implementing EII, I've been rewriting how attributes are processed.
For more technical details, take a look at the [tracking issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/131229)
The first thing I chose to work on does not actually have anything to do with name resolution.

A large change that got merged in december, is one that simply gives the HIR its own data types to represent attributes.
Lowering can then turn ast attributes into hir attributes.
Another change is to refactor the `rustc_attr` crate.

You'd think that this is where attributes are parsed.
This was true, for about 10 of the 100 attributes.
Other attributes were parsed in all kinds of other places.
At the time of writing, the `rustc_attr` crate does not exist anymore.
Instead, we have `rustc_attr_data_structures` and `rustc_attr_parsing`.

And this is where I like to remember the rule: [parse, don't validate](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/).
We've seen what validation looks like. Parsing will be different.
The plan for the future is to move the parsing of every single built-in attribute to `rustc_attr_parsing`.
`rustc_attr_data_structures` contains various structures.
These are the structures we parse into.

By making sure we can produce values of these types, we are forced to valide all kinds of things, and emit diagnostics during parsing.
When parsing has succeeded, the data types in `rustc_attr_data_structures` serve as a proof that their structure is correct.
Code after parsing can safely ignore validation.
This means that in the future, `rustc_attr_data_structures` will also contain an enum like this:

```rust
pub enum AttributeKind {
    DocComment(/* ... */),
    Cfg(/* ... */),
    Inline(/* ... */),
    Stability(/* ... */),
    Repr(/* ... */),

    /* and about 95 more */
}
```

*This* is what attributes are parsed into.
This serves as an exhaustive list of every possible built-in attribute.
I do unfortunately still see the need for another crate: `rustc_attr_validation`,
but in it we can exhaustively match on this enum to make sure that when a new one is added, we don't forget to validate.

After that, we can start thinking about moving the parsing of some of these attributes upwards in the compiler.
Even the AST can have an enum like `AttributeKind`.
An attribute like `#[provides_implementation_for(core::panic_impl)]` could then be parsed *before* name resolution,
which means we can give it a `NodeId` and actually resolve the path in it!

With some luck, in another few months or so, we can then finally implement externally implementable items.
And remember, parse, don't validate!
