  The rust compiler is a giant project. Hundreds of contributors help maintain it.
  I consider myself quite lucky that this maintenance work has become my full time job.
  Most of that time though, isn't spent to work on new language features, though there is a bit of that.
  In fact, most maintenance is barely visible to users of the language.
  So what does maintaining the compiler look like?

I was talking to Mara (<User name="m-ou-se"/>) today about what I was busy working on.
I said that I was fixing weird behavior of `#[deprecated]` attributes.
Last week <User name="WaffleLapkin" /> and I discovered some subtle bugs in that.
Yesterday, I finished up a pull request that fixed unsizing coercions in the new trait solver.

Both of these tiny projects I quite enjoyed, and they represent what most of my days are filled with.
Subtle bugs, small inconveniences in the compiler's source, some slightly confusing error messages.
And not just my days; there are hundreds, if not thousands of these small tasks that, one by one, improve the rust compiler just a bit.
And so a large group of people work on these kinds of tasks, every day.

When many small tasks, together result in new compiler features, then those are easily visible to end users.
But the bug fixes and internal refactors required for them are not.
We do often share those among other maintainers.
For example, when a bug causes a small snippet of trivial code not to compile, we all laugh.
How did we miss that? Why are there no tests for that? How did nobody notice that before?

So, Mara convinced me to share some of that.
From now on, I intend to write about some of the things I work on in the compiler.
I'll tag them with <Tag name="maintenance" />.

I've already written a couple!

Note that these blog posts won't be super exciting.
They won't fundamentally change Rust.
There's the [rust blog](blog.rust-lang.org) for that already.
However, sometimes they might show some interesting bugs,
or show progress in a larger project.
That's what compiler maintenance is like!
