    As far as I can tell, there are three major gorups of people. Those who've never seen Algebraic effects (lucky them),
    those who have seen them and kind of hate them, for various reasons, and programming languages researchers or enthusiasts
    who just can't shut up about them. I'll start with warning those in the second category that I'm a category three person. Don't be afraid though!
    This post will be about why I think this divide exists, which I hope is interesting even if you'd rather had us effect-people just shut up...
